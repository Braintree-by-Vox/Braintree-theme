Managing statutory and compliance documentation can be complex and time-consuming. Disorganised records slow down audits, outdated documents risk non-compliance, and missing files disrupt workflows. 

Braintree Compliance Document Tracker provides a centralised solution to keep your compliance records organised, accessible, and up to date - reducing risk.

Businesses that trade with 3rd parties, with heavy assets and employees, will benefit from the Compliance Document Tracker.

Solution Overview

Braintree’s Compliance Document Tracker helps you capture and manage external compliance documents. Government certificates, safety inspections, and employee certifications get linked to your master data in Dynamics 365 Business Central. 

Monitor expiry dates, request updates from third parties, and ensure timely renewals, all from one centralised platform.
